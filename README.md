*Comments in the code are written in swedish.*

## About
This was a project I did in the course IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering at KTH.
The goal was to come up with a project idea and develop that program for
ChipKIT Uno32 development board together with ChipKIT Basic I/O.

## Features
- **Single player:** You can play against the computer on four different difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible).
- **Multiplayer:** You can play against your buddy.
- **Highscore:** You can enter your name before game start and if you take a record your name will be added to the highscore list.
- **Non volatile memory:** The highscore list is saved in EEPROM on the ChipKIT Basic I/O, so even if the electricity is turned off the highscore list will still be stored.
